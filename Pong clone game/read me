I took a pong clone, made some changes. I suggest Pong as an early project for any programming student. This code is easy to make adjustments
some suggestions
re type this code and make some changes of your own
adjust the paddle and ball speed
adjust the size of the paddles
adjust the size of the game screen and the boundries of the paddles
add something to the game to make it your own, such as changing the player names or drawing a line down the center of the screen.

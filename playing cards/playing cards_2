Playing Cards, version 2.0 

ask the player to choose a suit: spades, clubs, diamonds or Hearts
which is a 1/4 chance of being right

I did not need to use a function for each card, however this is a good example 
of functions.

print(" Welcome to my card game, you win points be choosing a correct suit and number or face card")
print(" Choose a suit (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds)")
print(" You have a 1/4 chance at winning 5 points, if you pick the correct suit")
print(" 1) Type 1 for spades")
print(" 2) Type 2 for clubs")
print(" 3) Type 3 for hearts")
print(" 4) Type 4 for diamonds")

# ask the user to choose a suit
suit = input(" Which suit do you want?.. ")

# ask the player if they want to choose a number or face card
print(" There is a 9 / 14 or 36 / 52 chance a random card will be a number card")
print(" There is a 4 / 13 or 16 / 52 chance the card will be a face card")
print(" Face cards are: Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces")
print(" If you choose a number card and you get a number card, you win 10 points")

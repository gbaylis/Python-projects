While creating the GUI calculator project, I got an idea of a GUI that can translate characters 
from one language, into english (or as close as a translation as possible). I do not speak Russian
however I like the look of the Russian alphabet because it has some characters that are similiar to the English alphabet
and some characters that are very different from anything you would see in English.
Cyrillic is the name of the type of alphabet that is used in Russian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian and other Slavic languages.

online income

If a person has an online job that does not provide a pay stub
but wants to keep track of how much money they earned in a year.
The user can move the same amount of money from the online wallet their paypal account to pay their bills.
Then leave behing a small ammount of money, perhaps $10 and move the rest of the money to their bank account. 
'''

deposit_1 = float(input(" What dollar amount do you transfer from your online wallet to your pay pal account, the amount should be consistent?... "))

# pay pal deposit
deposit_2 = float(input(" How much do you leave behind in your pay pal account?...   "))

# find out how much goes to bank each transaction after 
# a small amount is left in the pay pal
deposit_3 = deposit_1 - deposit_2

pay_pal = float(input(" How much is in the pay pal at the end of the year...  "))

# pay pal total EOY divided by what you always leave in the pay pal
total_1 = pay_pal / deposit_2

# pay pal EOY / pay pal deposit * how much you move from your
# online wallet to pay pal
total = total_1 * deposit_1

# print what the user earned this year from their online job
print("*" * 25)
print(" This year, you earned")
print(total,2)
print(" from your online job")
print("*" * 25)
